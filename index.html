    <h3>About the Book</h3>
    <p>The book you are about to read is the true story of my father Bert Groves’ experiences during World War 2, written by him and in his own words.</p>
    <p>It highlights the loss of innocence of a generation, with young men being plucked away from their normal lives for, as in my father’s case, six and a half years.</p>
    <p>These were men who volunteered to drive their petrol tankers through the oncoming theatre of war, from France, across Europe through to North Africa and finishing in Berlin.</p>
    <p>The memories are both humorous and sad, but incredibly detailed throughout.</p>
    <p>He wrote these memoirs shortly before his own premature death at the age of 58 in 1976, following a different type of battle, this time against Cancer.</p>
    <p>When reading this book, bear in mind that it was written in 1976 as a different a world compared to today as it was compared to 1945.</p>
    <p>You may find some of his comments slightly less than what we accept now as politically correct, but this man gave six and a half years of his life for his country and defending its people against tyranny.</p>
    <p>I certainly do not have the right to alter his words, but he had earned the right to speak them.</p>
    <p>When I started to compile his account, I had no idea what a journey of discovery it would be for me, getting to know and admire a completely different person to the one I had loved as my Dad, and my mate.</p>
    <p>Perhaps it’s significant that I am now the same age as my Dad when he wrote these memoirs, this story, that I can now pass on to my daughter, her generation, and beyond.</p>
